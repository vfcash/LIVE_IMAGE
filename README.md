The VFCASH network has been mostly unused for the majority of its life span. Unfortunately the server hosting the VFCASH services was compromised on two occasions that I am aware of in the last 6 months, for this reason I have decided to permanently terminate the only remaining VFCASH node.

The "blockchain" file is from the 12th of February 2023 at 19:52 hours with the last transaction being made on the 30th of November 2022. Some time between 19:52 hours and 08:15 hours (UTC) an attacker who either already had access to the server from a prior date or gained access between the specified hours performed a surgical take down of the VFCASH network by erasing all of the files from the server related to the VFCASH program and the two blockchain backups on removable, but at the time mounted drives - leaving only the www directory intact and other services the server had running. I estimate the time of the attack to have been 03:17 hours.

I don't know how access was gained to the server and for this reason, it's become more hassle that it is worth to keep the service running.

This repository contains the blockchain file and the www directory for the now defunct [vfcash.uk](https://vfcash.uk) website.

The VFCASH network has been mostly unused for all of it's existance however I kept running the service as a hobby. Unfortuantely the server hosting the VFCASH services kept getting hacked, so for this reason I have decided to permanently terminate hosting VFCASH.

The "blockchain" file is from the 12th of February 2023 at 00:00 hours. Some time between 00:00 hours and 08:15 hours (UTC) an attacker who either already had access to the server from a prior date or gained access between those hours performed a very surgical take down of the VFCASH network by erasing all of the files from the server related to the VFCASH program and the two blockchain backups on removable hardware - leaving only the http dir intact and other services the server had been running.

I don't know how access was gained to the server and for this reason, it's become more hassle that it is worth for me to keep the service running.

This repository contains the blockchain file, and the www directory for the [vfcash.uk](https://vfcash.uk) website.
